Welcome! This repository contains several data sets I have found interesting and have explored or am currently exploring. The projects are listed below.

#### Projects
1. [Pokemon Battles](#Pokemon-Battles)

## Pokemon Battles

Growing up watching and playing Pokemon, I was instantly drawn to this data set which contains simulated Pokemon battles between two Pokemon of varying types. The goal is to predict the outcome of certain battles given previously observed outcomes.

My visualization, analysis, and prediction results for this data set can be found [here](/PokemonBattles).

The origin of this data set can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/terminus7/pokemon-challenge/home).
